/// These classes reflect the design on page 385 in the "Programming Game AI by Example" book.  There are some minor changes/improvements from
/// What is written, but perhaps the biggest design decision to consider is if they need to be templated with an entity type.  I am going to 
/// need to run through some simulation code to know for sure, but for now I am going to steer away from doing that! The actual implementation
/// of some of these methods will reside in a cpp file.  Once the decision is final they will either stay in a cpp, or change to an 'hpp' file
/// using a nested include technique to work with a templated class.  Hopefully this will not be necessary.
