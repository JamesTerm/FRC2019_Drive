/* DriveForward
 * This method uses two PID loops to drive straight and the requesred encoder distance
 * The first PID loop runs for the 60% of requested distance, using the navx to correct angle
 * the second PID loop runs for the remaining distance, at at a lower speed to improve accuracy.
 * 
 * What is a PID loop?
 * A PID loop is a feedback loop that uses an input stream to control an output stream. In our case, the NavX angle controls left/right motor speeds.
 * 	P - Proportion
 * 		outputs a value proportional to error (desired value minus expected value). 
 6 		For our code: We want to be facing at the same direction the whole time, so any deviation from that value is error.  
 9  I - Integral
 6 		The general term for integral is area under a graph. If you think of a graph of time versus error, integral would be the area between
 9 		the x-axis and the graph. Integral is used for error correction. Integral is not always neccessary, so you may see its scalar value (ki)
 * 		set to zero. 
 * 		For our code: Say we wanted to drive a specified distance and our robot was alrealy only 1 encoder tick away. The kp and kd values would not
 * 		provide enough power to push that last bit, because the values are so small and in the real world there's friction and stuff that would stop it.
 * 		The ki value, will observe error over time and, if it is high enough, provide that small boost that the robot needs.
 *  D - Derivative
 * 		Another way to think of derivative is slope. Derivate is the slope of the line tangent to a graph at a specific point.
 * 		Going back to the graph described above, derivitive will find how steep our error line is, aka the rate of change of error.
 * 		If we did not have kd, then kp would always overshoot the desired value, then start swinging back towards it, and overshoot again,
 * 		kinda like a pendulum trying to be at 0 degrees, it would always overshoot. Think of the kd value like a finger pushing against the pendulum.
 * 		When the pendulum isn't moving, the finger doesn't push at all, but the faster the pendulum moves, the more kd pushes back. Once tuned properly, kd
 * 		will stop the pendulum exactly at zero degrees, without it overshooting or pushing the pendulum back away. 
 * 		For our code: with only ki, the robot would oscillate around zero degress while driving forward and never stay there. With kd, the derivate will push against
 * 		ki to hopefully stop turning exactly at zero degrees.
 * 		derivative = current error - error prior.
